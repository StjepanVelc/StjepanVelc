## Profile

Backend-focused developer with strong interest in **algorithmic thinking, systems design and applied mathematics**.  
I build modular applications and simulation tools, combining practical backend development with linear algebra and foundational quantum concepts.

My approach is structured, analytical and architecture-oriented — focused on understanding how systems work under the hood.
